 - Setting NarrowHeroBoxes to required and force-enabled since it is required for the script to function properly.

25   October 2025 - v0.2.9

12    August 2025 - v0.2.3

 6    August 2025 - v0.2.0
 - Mostly rebuilt this addon from the ground up to fix the game settings just before the game loads - rather than on a 1 second timer (which was starting to be too short for some people).
 - This is Script Hub v.4.0.0/v4.0.1 agnostic.
 - For other addon creators - this Overrides OpenIC().
 5    August 2025 - v0.1.12
 - Properly sharing settings with the BrivGemFarm.

 - Changed how the addon finds the settings file with Irisiri's edit.
29   January 2025 - v0.1.7
 - Changing default LevelupAmountIndex to x100 because more people use Level Up addon than don't. And everyone *should* be using the Level Up addon.

25   October 2024 - v0.1.5
