 - Also cleaning up some doubled up variables.
 3  December 2025 - v0.5.2
 - Hopefully fixing an issue with Celebration claiming.
21  November 2025 - v0.5.1
 - Now that Trials has a memory read for when it is ready to claim - I have decided to make Trials check every 8 hours ± 30 minutes to save on unnecessary server calls.
10  November 2025 - v0.5.0
 - Fixed a long-ish standing bug with CDP that caused Cooldown timers to not properly populate after a check.
10  November 2025 - v0.4.12

 - Potentially fixing a bug where Trials would go unclaimed for ages. Also potentially breaking it. Time will tell.

08  November 2025 - v0.4.10
 - Fixed a stupid mistake that caused memory read checks to keep repeating even when they shouldn't.
05  November 2025 - v0.4.9
 - Adding some checks and balances to prevent runaway claim counters. This doesn't solve the underlying issue though.
25   October 2025 - v0.4.8
 - Fixing an issue with the Free Bonus Chests not working for platforms other than Steam.
21   October 2025 - v0.4.7

23 September 2025 - v0.4.4

28    August 2025 - v0.4.2

11    August 2025 - v0.4.1
 - Fixed some copy-paste visual errors. (Nothing functional.)
 8    August 2025 - v0.4.0
 - Functionally this should be no different than before. Visually it is a little different. This update is Script Hub version agnostic.

 - Using the g_ServerCall class properly this time. There should be no change in functionality - just now more in-line with standards.

30      July 2025 - v0.3.9
 - Randomising the 8 hour delay to ± 30 minutes so the timers don't all try to check around the same time every 8 hours. Hopefully it'll help spread them out a bit - but still average around 8 hours.
 - When a Trial is not running and is on cooldown - the Trials Status message will tell you when it can be joined.
24      July 2025 - v0.3.8
 - Adding support for guide quest rewards.
18      July 2025 - v0.3.7

 2  November 2024 - v0.0.7
 - Changed the way the timers work to avoid drift.
23   October 2024 - v0.0.6
